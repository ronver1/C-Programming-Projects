# C-Programming-Projects
A catalog of my ECE 312H: Introduction to Software Design and Implementation Lab Projects at the University of Texas Austin

## Academic Integrity Notice
- This repository is shared for educational and portfolio purposes only.
- If you are currently enrolled in ECE 319H or a similar course, please do not copy this code directly.
- The files in this catalog require the autograder files to run properly. I've only included the files I wrote in this repository

## Overview
This repository contains my programming assignments, labs, and projects from
ECE 312H: Introduction to Software Design and Implementation at
The University of Texas at Austin.

The course develops strong foundations in:
- C programming and memory management
- Pointers, arrays, and dynamic data structures
- Modular software design and abstraction
- Debugging, testing, and program correctness
- Algorithmic thinking and computational problem solving

These projects emphasize clean code, efficiency, and low-level understanding
that directly support embedded systems, firmware, and systems programming.

## Technologies & Tools
### Languages
- C (primary language)
- Basic Bash / terminal workflows
### Concepts Practiced
- Pointer arithmetic and memory layout
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, realloc, free)
- Structs and abstract data types
- Recursion and iterative algorithms
- File I/O and parsing
- Defensive programming and edge-case handling

## Key Learning Outcomes
Through this course, I developed:
- Strong proficiency in low-level C programming
- Deep understanding of memory, pointers, and data structures
- Ability to design modular, maintainable software
- Experience writing robust code that handles edge cases
- Debugging skills using systematic testing and analysis

These skills are foundational for:
- Embedded systems & firmware engineering
- Operating systems and systems programming
- Performance-critical software development
- Hardware–software co-design
